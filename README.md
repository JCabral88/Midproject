The goal of this project is to explore a little bit more of temperature variation around the globe.
Further on I will focus in portugal and explore how temperature is floating here, having Lisbon as city reference.

During this exploration I will try to create some interactive world maps with plotly, where user can check avarage temperature of each country.

Also will try to predict how in the avarage temperature will rise or drop for the upcoming years


DATASET description:

Early data was collected by technicians using mercury thermometers, where any variation in the visit time impacted measurements. 
In the 1940s, the construction of airports caused many weather stations to be moved. 
In the 1980s, there was a move to electronic thermometers that are said to have a cooling bias.

the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. 
It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country).

Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature

Other files include:

Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)
Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv)
Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)

STEPS:

1 - Explore GlobalTemperaturesBYCountry.xlsx file
As an intro I will display an interactive world map where avarge temperature is displayed.
Then will display plot with all countrys where we can identify hotest and coldest country.


2 - Start checking for a "global warming" (rise of temperature) in the GlobalTemperatures.xlsx file
I want to create a plot where we can see the avarage temperature flotation by years

3 - With GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.xlsx I will start to focus on Portugal temperature flotations.

4 - Conclusion will be based on the data results, will try to provide solutions to mitigate temperatures arise or drop depending on final conclusion.
